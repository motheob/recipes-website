  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Vegetable oil</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Margarine</li>
    <li>Flour</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>
    <li>White sugar</li>
    <li>Ground cinnamon</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol type="1">
    <li>In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.</li>
    <li>In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the boiling mixture. Reduce heat to low and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time. Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.</li>
    <li>Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot oil. Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon; roll churros in the mixture while still hot.</li>
  </ol>
